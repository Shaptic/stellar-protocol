## Simple Summary
This SEP defines a standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Stellar network, including an issuance model and metadata fields. It draws inspiration from the [EIP-721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).


## Motivation
A standard interface for NFTs that makes NFTs issued by any ecosystem application (such as a wallet or marketplace) accessible and interoperable with any other ecosystem application supporting NFTs.


## Abstract
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can describe many types of assets, from digital collectibles to physical items. This protocol defines a standard series of steps that NFT creators should use to issue NFTs on the Stellar network, defines metadata to describe an NFT, and specifies how the metadata is linked to the NFT asset defined in this SEP.

The issuance model involves four steps:

  1. An account is created specifically to represent the NFT in the Stellar ledger.
  2. The account configures itself with metadata describing the NFT.
  3. The account issues a new Stellar asset representing ownership over said NFT to a distribution account.
  4. Any account holding that asset lays claim to the NFT.

The NFT model involves two levels of indirection in order to minimize on-chain storage:

    +---------------+      +----------+      +---------+
    |  Stellar NFT  | ---> | metadata | ---> |   NFT   |
    |  account data |      |   JSON   |      | content |
    +---------------+      +----------+      +---------+


## Specification
This SEP defines an [issuance model](#issuance-model) that defines how NFT assets are issued on Stellar and a [metadata specification](#nft-metadata-specification) that defines how data about the NFT is captured. The metadata is stored in a way such that the Stellar network guarantee its authenticity.

### Issuance Model
Standard issuance of NFTs involves the following components:

  - An **issuing account**: This is an account which represents the NFT itself. It is responsible for minting the supply of tokens as well as storing information about how to find the NFT asset. We'll refer to it as `A`.
  - A **token**: This is an asset issued by the issuing account. Its _asset code_ should be descriptive. We'll refer to this asset token as `T`.
  - A **distribution account**: This is an account which will actually distribute the tokens. Its funded by `A` and initially holds the entire supply of `T`. We'll refer to it as `B`

The parties must take the following steps:

  1. Someone creates the issuing account `A` to represent the NFT.
  2. `A` stores a reference to the NFT's [metadata](#nft-account-description) pointer.
  4. `A` creates a distribution account, `B`.
  5. `B` creates a trustline to `T`.
  6. `A` issues the full supply of tokens `T` to `B`.
  7. (Optional) `A` locks itself out of its account.
  8. `B` distributes `T` to the world.

This corresponds to the following series of (pseudocode) operations:

    A = CreateAccountOp(...)
    ManageDataOp(source: A, key: "type", value: "...")
    T = "AssetCode:A"
    B = CreateAccountOp(source: A, ...)
    ChangeTrustOp(source: B, asset: T, limit: <supply>)
    PaymentOp(source: A, destination: B, asset: T, amount: <supply>)
    SetOptionsOp(source: A, masterWeight: 0)

Note that Step 7 _permanently_ locks the issuing account which makes it immutable, meaning that the issuer can neither modify the NFT metadata pointer it stored nor issue more tokens. For fixed supply tokens and tokens intended to be immutable, Step 7 is recommended.

Ownership of the token directly conveys ownership of a unit of the NFT, however that may be defined. Other scenarios such as ownership transfers via payments are built on top of this basic issuance model and are thus extraneous to this SEP.

Other issuance models may exist and may be compatible with the following specification, but this is the standard issuance model on Stellar.

### NFT Specification
This specification is partially inspired by Ethereum's [EIP-721 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) on NFTs; however, it is generalized to arbitrary asset types (i.e. not necessarily images).

In order to minimize the costs of creating an NFT (i.e. on-chain storage), the issuing account only stores a reference to the NFT metadata which is stored off-chain.

#### NFT Account Description
An issuing account should specify its `homedomain` (via `SetOptionsOp`). It should also configure the token in its domain's `stellar.toml` file (see [SEP-1](https://stellar.org/sep-1#currency-documentation)) if appropriate. This ensures compatibility with the existing ecosystem (for example, rendering it in wallets).

There are two ways to configure an account for an NFT and both involve storing data entries within the account. These are simple key-value pairs configured with `ManageDataOp`. Its standard limitations apply: field names and their values can only be 64 bytes each.

##### 1. URL Storage
There are two **required** fields on the account itself:

| Field  | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `url`  | A [URL][url] pointing to the "first hop" of metadata about the NFT |
| `hash` | A [SHA-256](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4634#section-4.1) digest of the metadata referenced by the `url` |

The `hash` is provided to ensure integrity of the metadata that the account is pointing to. This prevents the data at the destination from being modified without explicit knowledge and approval by the issuer.

**Warning**: If the hash does not match the metadata content, you should carefully consider the NFT's authenticity.

##### 2. IPFS Content ID (Legacy Method)
Existing ecosystem solutions lean heavily on IPFS to store NFT content. While this standard aims to free up the ecosystem from dependence on IPFS, it should also work with these existing, organic conventions.

For the legacy variant, there is only one **required** field on the account itself:

| Field      | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `ipfshash` | An [IPFS Content IDentifier][cid] corresponding to the location of the metadata |

#### IPFS Storage
If you are issuing a new token and plan to use IPFS, you should use [Method 1](#url-storage) and use an IPFS URL (`ipfs://...`) rather than the legacy method.

If you are the issuer and decide to use IPFS, make sure you understand its implications. You must ensure that the resource is addressable and accessible on the IPFS network by running your own IPFS node or entrusting a provider to do so. Even to look up the NFT, users must use an IPFS lookup service to actually resolve the metadata. For example, [this URL](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmaydGEshbL7HMQkD6FZPcMeEt6o15aC4p4P82VxQ7amjy) resolves to the Meridian 2021 Hat NFT via Cloudflare's IPFS node.

#### Standard Metadata Specification
This section describes the metadata itself rather than how to find it.

The metadata must be valid JSON and must contain the following **required** fields:

| Field       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `name` | a short name or title for the NFT |
| `description` | a longer, more-detailed description of the NFT |
| `type` | a [Media Type][mediatype] describing the NFT's primary format (pointed to by `url`) |
| `url`  | a [URL][url] pointing to the actual NFT contents |
| `issuer` | a Stellar public key ([`G...`](https://stellar.org/protocol/sep-23)) corresponding to the account which issued this NFT |
| `code` | the NFT's asset code |

For example,

```json
{
  "name": "A demonstration of NFT metadata",
  "description": "This is a description of the cool NFT used in this demo.",
  "type": "image/png",
  "url": "https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/I/m/RickAstleyNeverGonnaGiveYouUp7InchSingleCover.jpg",
  "issuer": "GALAXYVOIDAOPZTDLHILAJQKCVVFMD4IKLXLSZV5YHO7VY74IWZILUTO",
  "code": "DEMOASSET"
}
```

means that the `DEMOASSET:GALAXYVOIDAOPZTDLHILAJQKCVVFMD4IKLXLSZV5YHO7VY74IWZILUTO` asset represents [this image](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/I/m/RickAstleyNeverGonnaGiveYouUp7InchSingleCover.jpg).

There are other fields which are **optional** but standardized:

| Field       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| fulldescription | an *even longer* description of the NFT than afforded by the `description` field, encoded in base64 |
| image | a [URL][url] pointing to an image representation of the NFT |
| video | a [URL][url] pointing to a video representation of the NFT |
| audio | a [URL][url] pointing to a audio representation of the NFT |
| domain | a [domain name](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1) corresponding to a place that owns or renders this NFT | 

These fields should be self-explanatory.

### A Full Example
We start with an official SDF NFT: the [Meridian 2021 hat NFT](https://www.litemint.com/items/GDOA2FECYKBVG2RQYG5JQO6EBLCDBWZ7MFBEZY6AIBJ4NDXV3XEVCVBC/MERIDIAN2021). It's issued by [this account](https://horizon.stellar.org/accounts/GDOA2FECYKBVG2RQYG5JQO6EBLCDBWZ7MFBEZY6AIBJ4NDXV3XEVCVBC/) and has the following data entry:

```json
{
  "ipfshash": "UW1heWRHRXNoYkw3SE1Ra0Q2RlpQY01lRXQ2bzE1YUM0cDRQODJWeFE3YW1qeQ=="
}
```

Upon decoding the value from base64 (since a `ManageDataOp`'s value is just raw bytes), we get an [IPFS CID][cid]:

    QmaydGEshbL7HMQkD6FZPcMeEt6o15aC4p4P82VxQ7amjy

Looking this up on IPFS [via CloudFlare](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmaydGEshbL7HMQkD6FZPcMeEt6o15aC4p4P82VxQ7amjy) gives us the full metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "Meridian 2021: Hat",
  "description": "Virtual swag from Meridian 2021!  Find out more about Meridian at https://meridian.stellar.org",
  "image": "ipfs://QmTAQ1e5zD4rxEspDgSZNgqXb73LBEj2wpQkDTj1UvCmv6",
  "url": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTAQ1e5zD4rxEspDgSZNgqXb73LBEj2wpQkDTj1UvCmv6",
  "code": "MERIDIAN2021",
  "issuer": "GDOA2FECYKBVG2RQYG5JQO6EBLCDBWZ7MFBEZY6AIBJ4NDXV3XEVCVBC",
  "domain": "meridian.litemint.store",
  "supply": 50,
  "video": "ipfs://QmeDxfvNpoizLxP4xLNrx1QuykPSqXEyZL8tVceZGudcvs"
}
```

We can see that this account [really does](https://horizon.stellar.org/operations/164563600389443587) own and issue this asset, meaning the NFT is genuine.


## Design Rationale

### On the issuance model
The issuance model follows Stellar's [standard model for issuing assets](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/issuing-assets/how-to-issue-an-asset/): there's an _issuing account_ and a _distribution account_. The benefits of this model are described in the linked document, but the most important one is this: it makes it easier to track supply. In the world of NFTs, it's really important to track how many of a particular token are in circulation, and using a distribution account achieves this goal.

### On the metadata specification
  * The recommended metadata pointer method is via `url` since we don't want to enforce reliance on IPFS. Since not all issuers will use `ipfshash`, which already provides integrity by including the hash within the [CID][cid], this method needs the `hash` field alongside it to further NFT authenticity.

  * While `ipfs://cid` _is_ a URL, we allow `ipfshash` for backward compatibility with existing ecosystem conventions. It also highlights the popularity of IPFS as a storage mechanism in the NFT ecosystem.


## Security Concerns
While there are no direct security concerns to the network introduced by this SEP, the trust model of NFTs deserves some clarification.

Digital assets are infinitely and perfectly reproduceable by virtue of being digital. Thus, the goal of an NFT should **not** be to represent ownership or possession of a particular digital asset, but rather to represent the existence of a particular _relationship_ with the issuer.

Those processing an NFT should take care to ensure that the `issuer` field matches the account referencing the NFT, and that the `code` is in fact an asset issued by said account. Without these two links, you cannot make any conclusions about the NFT.
